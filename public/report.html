                This analysis focuses on the current top 50 ranked FPL managers worldwide, representing the elite 0.0005% of over 10 million players.
                The table below categorizes players into two key groups: Template Core (owned by over 35% of these top managers) and Key Differentials (owned by 5-20%).
                The 'Count' shows how many players fall into each category, 'Average Points' indicates their scoring performance, and 'Ownership Range' shows the spread of ownership percentages within the top 50.
            </p>

            <p>
                Understanding these metrics helps identify both the essential players driving elite performance and the differential picks that could give you an edge.
                High ownership in the Template Core suggests these players are frequently selected for maintaining rank, while differentials represent calculated risks the top managers are taking.

            <p>This section analyzes key strategic decisions made by the top 50 managers, focusing on four critical aspects 
            of FPL management. Note that chip usage statistics may show more than 50 managers using certain chips - this is because 
            managers move in and out of the top 50 throughout the season, so we capture historical chip usage from all managers who 
            have been in the top 50 at some point. Understanding how these elite managers approach team value, chip usage, captain selection, 
            and squad structure can provide valuable insights for your own decision-making.</p>
